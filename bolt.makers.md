## For the hackathon 

- Weekly timelines that needs to be delivered as release and information , 
- We keep doing what we are doing 
- We release the SDK for the college hackathon 2nd.sdk 
- Make a repo , initialise with basic services that are already working , so we transport all those services 
- Integrate lightning, bitcoin 
- Lnbits could be used 
- A voting system can be implemented with reputation (1/2f threshold)

- Divide the task from UI/SDK/Services and Integration 
- We can have the testing also, testing is quite important , we should start integrating that for now.
- Hyperspace implementation , this invoves poeple uploading files to thier nodes or some public nodes
- Use case : Photo Use Case, where users could use the editor to upload single or multiple photos with meta-data , now this metadata could be defined by the user (Key-Value)

```
 type Inventory
     {
       "vendor":"VENDOR_SCHEMA",
       "amount":1000,
       "item":"Honey",
       "location":"Dharamshala",
       "selling_price":"",
       "@date":29 September 2022,
       
     }
```

- Just to iterate if some one is uploading the honey photograph, they can put all these details, we can come up with some UI- use case is tracking supply chain
- One can pay or buy hence a small e-commerce related app on nostr and second.exchange
