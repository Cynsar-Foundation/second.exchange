# Second.Exchange: An Open Source Social Media Experiment


## Introduction

Welcome to Second.Exchange, an experimental social media platform that aims to revolutionize the way we create and consume content online. Our mission is to empower content creators by associating value with their work, thereby fostering quality output and meaningful discussions.

Unlike traditional social media platforms, Second.Exchange is built on the principle of censorship resistance. We believe in the power of free speech and the exchange of ideas, and we're committed to maintaining a platform that upholds these values.

Second.Exchange was built on the [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools) protocol, which operates without a central authority.

Now , its built on [Willow Protocl](http://willowprotocol.org)

## Current Version 

We are working on releasing version based on willow protocol, check [willow](http://willowprotocol.org). We moved out of nostr due to its complicated nature and prone to centralisation.

1. Nostr is best in many ways but it leaves users to choose where to store data.
2. Nostr has NIP's that may come with a lot of disagreements and confusions over what you can do with your relay.

### Willow works best in our case

1. Works from browser and has inbuilt data stores that can be synced with other peers.


## Key Features

1. Create blog posts, content, or collections that are stored on the client-side and can be synced by anyone over the internet.
2. Follow people and content that interest you live peer syncing only when you want.
3. Group content based on your preferences and topics of interest only when you want.
4. Future features in the pipeline include adding tips, votes, and more.
5. Pay for content to support creators.
6. Take away your content to other services such as Nostr, Blue Sky, etc.
