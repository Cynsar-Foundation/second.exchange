# Second.Exchange: An Open Source Social Media Experiment

## Introduction

Welcome to Second.Exchange, an experimental social media platform that aims to revolutionize the way we create and consume content online. Our mission is to empower content creators by associating value with their work, thereby fostering quality output and meaningful discussions.

Unlike traditional social media platforms, Second.Exchange is built on the principle of censorship resistance. We believe in the power of free speech and the exchange of ideas, and we're committed to maintaining a platform that upholds these values.

Second.Exchange is built on the [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools) protocol, which operates without a central authority.

## Key Features

1. Create blog posts, content, or collections that are stored on the client-side and relayed using Nostr.
2. Follow people and content that interest you.
3. Group content based on your preferences and topics of interest.
4. Future features in the pipeline include adding tips, votes, and more.
5. Pay for content to support creators.

## Getting Started

```bash

#### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

## Contribute to Second.Exchange

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. If you're new to open source, we recommend starting with a [good first issue](https://github.com/second-exchange/second-exchange/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Please note that we use the `main` branch as the default one. All the latest development changes are merged here. The `develop` branch is used for testing, and changes are deployed to production servers via PRs from `develop` to `main`.

Before submitting a PR, please ensure your changes have been thoroughly reviewed. Direct pushes to `main` or `develop` are restricted to maintain code quality.
