## What is second.exchange?

Right now, this tool can be used to promote content freely anywhere by anyone, we intend to make this tool for anyone to learn, discuss ideas with value associated to it. In our experiment, 1)communities tend to form around value, 2) the existing social media is free to use hence no quality output gets generated, 3) then there are issues of valuation.

What if we all who create content over the internet can make some value out of it? This is the goal of second.exchange

We intend to solve these issues by having this experiment in place.

## How is it different from other ?

Its kinda of lot of different ,this tool is censor resistant , we are just polishing content with some actions or value associated so that people who create can make a living out of it.

Based on Nostr-tools https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools

## Contribute back

👋 Get started contributing with a good first issue

Before explaining how you can contribute, It's worth mentioning that we use `main` branch as the default one. This makes it easier for us to have all the latest, development changes without affecting the current production version. Though, We don't use release branches to make the process a little bit easier!

Pushing to develop branch via PR deploys changes to testing environments.
Pushing to main branch via PR from develop deploys changes to production servers.
Pushing to main|develop directly will be restricted to make sure the PR's are reviewed.
Creating PRs end up in relation to develop by default.
Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. Everyone will be especially nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!
